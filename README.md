## Higher-level programming - Python
High-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. High-level language refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses, and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency.

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:

| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0x00-hello_world`](https://github.com/Habtwolde/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world) | It aims to learn about variables, basics commands (print) and handle strings with **Python** |
| [`0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions`](https://github.com/Habtwolde/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) | It aims to learn about if/else statements, loops, range and functions in **Python** |
| [`0x02-python-import_modules`](https://github.com/Habtwolde/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-python-import_modules) | It aims to learn how to import functions, how to create modules and how to use command line arguments in **Python** |

## Higher-level programming - Python
High-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. High-level language refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses, and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency.

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:
